## üíª Installation

There is no npm package, it's just 1 file you can fully customize. Download the single file of code (`src/app/snackbar-context.tsx`), add it to your project, and wrap your app with the context provider.

```
<SnackbarProvider>
...
</SnackbarProvider>
```

```
const { snackbar } = useSnackbar();
```

You will also need to install the package dependencies.

```
npm install framer-motion
npm install tailwindcss
```
