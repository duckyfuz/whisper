A lightweight and fully customizable React snackbar (toast) system built with **Framer Motion** and **TailwindCSS**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Instant API:** Simple and intuitive API - see below.

- **Customizable:** Easy-to-read code and fully styled with TailwindCSS, allowing you to extend and modify the system as you need.

- **Multiple Notification Types:** Supports `success`, `warning`, `error`, `info`, and `default` types.

- **Auto & Manual Dismissal:** In addition to auto-dismiss timers (default: 6 seconds), you can allow users to manually close snacks.

- **Stackable Alerts:** Maintain a queue of snacks with a configurable max count (default: 6), and clear them all with a provided function.

## üíª Installation

There is no npm package, it's just 1 file you can fully customize. Download the single file of code (`src/app/snackbar-context.tsx`), add it to your project, and wrap your app with the context provider.

```
<SnackbarProvider>
...
</SnackbarProvider>
```

You will also need to install the package dependencies.

```
npm install framer-motion
npm install tailwindcss
```
